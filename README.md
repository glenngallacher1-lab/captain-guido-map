# Captain Guido — Animated Voyage Map

This project powers the animated world map used on the Captain Guido website.

The map visualizes Captain Guido’s journey across global oceans as chapters are released.

## Features
- Animated ship path across the world
- Chapter-based route system
- Locked / unlocked locations
- Minimalist, cinematic design
- Built with Leaflet.js (no backend required)

## Editing the Route
To add or unlock chapters:
- Open `script.js`
- Edit the `chapters` array at the top
- Set `unlocked: true` when a chapter goes live

## Deployment
This project can be hosted using:
- GitHub Pages
- Any static website host

## Vision
As the story evolves, the map updates in real time—mirroring Captain Guido’s voyage and real-world ocean impact.
